## üöÄ About the Repository
This repository will serve as a collection of automation projects where I experiment with **Selenium** and other tools to automate web-based tasks. From automating form submissions to extracting data from websites, this repository will demonstrate various real-world use cases. Additionally, I will explore how AI can be integrated into these tasks to enhance automation workflows.

Technologies I will use in this repository include:
- **Selenium** for browser automation
- **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** for web scraping
- **AI/ML models** for integrating AI into automation
- **Python** for scripting and task automation

## üíª Projects
### Web Automation
These projects focus on automating various web-based activities such as:
- Filling forms automatically
- Simulating user actions (clicks, navigation, etc.)
- Testing web applications through automated browser interactions

### Web Scraping
Projects that scrape data from websites for various purposes:
- Data collection for analysis
- Gathering information from dynamic websites using Selenium
- Scraping from pages with heavy JavaScript

### AI Use Cases
Automation projects that integrate AI technologies:
- Using NLP models for text-based automation
- Image recognition for automated decision-making
- Data extraction from unstructured content using AI

### Other Automation Projects
Additional automation projects, including but not limited to:
- Automating desktop applications
- Scheduling automated tasks
- Building intelligent bots to perform daily repetitive tasks
